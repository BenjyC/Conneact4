## Conneact 4 

This is my own attempt at creating a Connect 4 game using React.

I was interested in attempting this after completing the React tutorial in which you create a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Connect 4 has a larger board size and has different behaviours (pieces fall to the bottom of columns/cannot be placed anywhere) 
so I thought it would be a fun challenge.
